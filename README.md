## PROJECT NAME- SOS DEVICE 

### INTRODUCTION:

With the help of new technology under the domain IoT (Internet of Things) we are trying to 
design a device which can be installed in a vehicle so that it notifies the hospital and police station in case of an accident. 
This device would be helpful when an accident occurs especially at a secluded spot or at such a time when there are no people around for help.
 
### OBJECTIVE:
* Instant help for the accident victim.
* Increase in the current survival rate.
* More Reliable aid mechanism.

### TECH STACK:
* IoT
* Shock/Crash Sensors 
* GPS Module
* GSM Module 
* Arduino
