## PROJECT NAME- 

### OBJECTIVE:
* Instant help for the accident victim.
* Increase in the current survival rate.
* More Reliable aid mechanism.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Technological advancement for the aid of accident victims.
NHTSA estimates that the combination of an airbag along with a seat belt reduces the
risk of death by 61% only. So how newer technologies can help increase this value and
notify the nearest hospital and police station simultaneously in case an accident occurs ,
especially at a secluded spot or at such a time where there are no people around for
help .
